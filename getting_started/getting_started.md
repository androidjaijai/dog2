# Getting Started

Welcome to the documentation portal for first time Pachyderm users! We've organized information into two sections:

1. [Local Installation](local_installation.html): Get Pachyderm deployed locally on OSX or Linux.
2. [Beginner Tutorial](beginner_tutorial.html): Learn to use Pachdyerm through a quick and simple tutorial.

If you'd like to read about the Pachyderm's open source and enterprise features before actually running it, check out the following:

- [The open source core](http://pachyderm.io/open_source.html)
- [Enterprise edition](http://pachyderm.io/enterprise.html)
- [Use Cases](http://pachyderm.io/use_cases.html)
